<center>					<h1>Force of Attraction between Bodies</h1></center></br></br>
						<p>
							A force of attraction is any type of force that causes objects to come together, even if those objects are not close to or touching each other. The first force that causes attraction is the gravitational force. According to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe. Gravity is an attractive force since any object with mass will experience a force of attraction from other objects with mass. Gravity is the reason for the statement 'What goes up must come down.'

							The second force that can cause attraction is the electric force, also known as the electrostatic force. While gravity affects objects with mass, electrostatic forces affect objects that have charge. Charge is determined by the number of electrons and protons in an object. Most objects are electrically neutral, which means they have an equal amount of electrons, which carry a negative charge, and protons, which carry a positive charge. But sometimes, objects can lose electrons and be positively charged, or gain electrons and become negatively charged. The attraction occurs when two objects of opposite charge are in close proximity, and the electrical force causes these objects to attract. Therefore, positive and negative charges will attract each other. Hence the saying 'Opposites attract.'

							The third force that may cause attraction is the magnetic force. The magnetic force attracts objects that have magnetic properties. A magnet will attract metals rich in iron, like steel, as well as nickel and cobalt. But when an object is magnetized, the magnetic force is attractive when a north magnetic pole is brought into close proximity to a south magnetic force. The main source of magnetism is electric currents. When charges move, there is an electric current. So charges that don't move are affected by the electric force and charges that move are affected by the magnetic force. Magnetic attraction can also be the reason behind the saying 'Opposites attract.'

						<center><h1>Mathematics - Algebra</h1></center></br></br>
						<p>
							Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning "reunion of broken parts"[1]) is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols;[2] it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.[3] As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. Much early work in algebra, as the Arabic origin of its name suggests, was done in the Middle East, by Persian[4][5] mathematicians such as al-Khwārizmī (780–850)[6] and Omar Khayyam (1048–1131).[7]
							Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.[8] For example, in {\displaystyle x+2=5} x+2=5 the letter {\displaystyle x} x is unknown, but the law of inverses can be used to discover its value: {\displaystyle x=3} x=3. In E = mc2, the letters {\displaystyle E} E and {\displaystyle m} m are variables, and the letter {\displaystyle c} c is a constant, the speed of light in a vacuum. Algebra gives methods for solving equations and expressing formulas that are much easier (for those who know how to use them) than the older method of writing everything out in words.
							The word algebra is also used in certain specialized ways. A special kind of mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an "algebra", and the word is used, for example, in the phrases linear algebra and algebraic topology.
							A mathematician who does research in algebra is called an algebraist.

						<center>					<h1>States of Matter</h1>
						</center> </br></br>
						<p>
							In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms that matter takes on. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many other states are known to exist only in extreme situations, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter and quark-gluon plasma, which occur in situations of extreme cold, extreme density and extremely high-energy color-charged matter respectively. Some other states are believed to be possible but remain theoretical for now. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.
							Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, but as well as neutral atoms, it contains a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely. Plasma is the most common form of visible matter in the universe.
