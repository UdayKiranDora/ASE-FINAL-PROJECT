<h1>The Zodiacal Constellations </h1>

<p1>         Constellations are named patterns of stars. All societies created them. The classical -- "ancient" -- constellations that populate our sky began in the
 lands of the middle east thousands of years ago,their origins largely lost to time. They passed through the hands of the ancient Greeks, who overlaid them with their legends and codified them 
in story and verse. During Roman times they were assigned Latin names.</p1></br>

<p2>         The constellations play an important role in modern astronomy. They bring order to the sky by dividing it into smaller segments, providing a base for 
naming celestial objects. Though the brighter stars commonly carry "proper names" that come mostly from Arabic, they are also assigned Greek letters and 
Arabic numbers to which are affixed the Latin possessive forms of the constellation names, Vega, for example, also known as "Alpha of Lyra," or "Alpha 
Lyrae." The IAU also adopted three-letter abbreviations for all the constellations and their possessives, Vega thus becoming Alpha Lyr.</p2>
